# DATA ANALYSIS WITH C++
In this repository there are several, but not all, files that contain C++ code.
The C++ code was built to analyse data from physics experiments during the Bachelor's degree course.
For each experiment I always had thousands to millions of data to analyse, and here are programmes that analyse data,
generate them and write them to .txt files.
There are also classes that I have built to help with the analysis.
